Indri Agent v1

* Requirements
  + Index build will be 100% external, only query support in v1
  + Many indexes will be supported via pre-registered paths
  + API will support stateful queries
  + Outstanding queries will be considered dead after 30 seconds idle
	+ Further ops MAY return an error
  + Use C++ API wrapped in Java
  + Exposed as a JADE agent
* API
  + Client -> Agent supported FIPA performatives
	+ REQUEST - begin query
	+ REQUEST - get next results
	+ CANCEL - close query
	  + no response
  + Agent -> Client supported performatives
	+ INFORM - query begun
	+ INFORM - query results
	+ FAILURE - query closed due to timeout
** Ontology
   + Query - sent from a client to begin a query
	 + =indexes[1..*]= - set of index names to be queried
	 + =query= - query string
	 + =fields[1..*]= - set of fields to be returned
   + QueryId - sent from the agent to notify query start
   + ResultRequest - sent from a client to get query results
	 + =queryId=
	 + =numResults=
   + QueryResult - sent from the agent to provide query results
	 + =queryId=
	 + =ResultEntry results[0..*]=
   + ResultEntry
	 + =data[field -> value] (map)= - requested fields
	 + =relevance=
	 + =snippet= (nil unless requested??, or should this be in 'data')
* JNI API
* Implementation
* Issues
** TODO Need to determine if doc ids should be integers
   + [[http://www.lemurproject.org/doxygen/lemur/html/namespacelemur_1_1api.html#a5][DOCID_T -> TERMID_T]]
   + [[http://www.lemurproject.org/doxygen/lemur/html/namespacelemur_1_1api.html#a3][TERMID_T -> int]]
* Ideas for future versions
** TODO Allow query timeout this to be configurable in future versions
