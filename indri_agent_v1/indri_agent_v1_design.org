Indri Agent v1

* Requirements
  + Index build will be 100% external, only query support in v1
  + Many indexes will be supported via pre-registered paths
  + API will support stateful queries
  + Outstanding queries will be considered dead after 30 seconds idle
	+ Further ops MAY return an error
  + Use C++ API wrapped in Java
  + Exposed as a JADE agent
* API
  + Client -> Agent supported FIPA performatives
	+ REQUEST - begin query
	+ REQUEST - get next results
	+ CANCEL - close query
	  + no response
  + Agent -> Client supported performatives
	+ INFORM - query begun
	+ INFORM - query results
	+ FAILURE - query closed due to timeout
** Ontology
   + Query - sent from a client to begin a query
	 + =indexes[1..*]= - set of index names to be queried
	 + =query= - query string
	 + =fields[1..*]= - set of fields to be returned
   + QueryId - sent from the agent to notify query start
   + ResultRequest - sent from a client to get query results
	 + =queryId=
	 + =numResults=
   + QueryResult - sent from the agent to provide query results
	 + =queryId=
	 + =ResultEntry results[0..*]=
   + ResultEntry
	 + =data[field -> value] (map)= - requested fields
	 + =relevance=
	 + =snippet= (nil unless requested??, or should this be in 'data')
* Implementation
** JNI API
   + =int query_begin(String indexPaths[], String query)=
     + return = query id or 0 on error
   + =Map<String, Object> query_next_results(int queryId, int resultCount, String fields[])=
   + =void query_close(int queryId)=
** TODO Rename Java Query class to something more specific
** Java API
   + Query class
   + Constructor takes args to begin
** Agent
* Document ID Allocations
  Offline/batch indexing should be able to handle this fine.
  | Begin     | End     | Thing     |
  |-----------+---------+-----------|
  | 1         | 499,999 | Email     |
  | 500,000   | 999,999 | Org notes |
  | 1,000,000 |         | ???       |
* Issues
** DONE Need to determine if doc ids should be integers
   CLOSED: [2013-10-19 Sat 16:29]
   As far as I can tell, it will be easier to work with Indri if using integers for document ids.
   This complicates several things but it's better than having to go through and redo the Indri code later.
   + [[http://www.lemurproject.org/doxygen/lemur/html/namespacelemur_1_1api.html#a5][DOCID_T -> TERMID_T]]
   + [[http://www.lemurproject.org/doxygen/lemur/html/namespacelemur_1_1api.html#a3][TERMID_T -> int]]
   + [[http://www.lemurproject.org/doxygen/lemur/html/structindri_1_1api_1_1QueryResult.html][This]] refers to internal and external doc IDs, but I don't see it integrated anywhere
* Ideas for future versions
** TODO Allow query timeout this to be configurable in future versions
** TODO Setup a system-global or UUID-based document ID allocation
** TODO Don't limit queries to 1,000 results
** TODO Don't use infinitely incrementing query id
